In todayâ€™s highly competitive mobile phone market, pricing plays a crucial role in a company's success. Bob, the founder of a new mobile company, aims to rival established brands like Apple and Samsung. However, he struggles with estimating the price of the mobile phones his company produces. To address this, Bob collected sales data from various companies to find patterns and relationships between mobile features (such as RAM, internal memory, etc.) and their corresponding price ranges.

This project leverages machine learning techniques to classify mobile phones into different price ranges, helping Bob make informed decisions without needing to predict the exact price. By identifying key features and building a model, the project provides valuable insights into price estimation, enabling Bob to better position his products in the market.
